## Planning
#
### Initial plan
#
Initially this project was planned as a planner tool, but after consulting  my mentor, it was switched to follow the walkthrough from the lessons on Rest-framework and React. The wireframe for that initial plan can be found if you follow this link: https://mikakallberg.github.io/wireframe-planner/
#
### Plan
#
- The current direction for this project is to follow the walkthrough given by Code Institute and add two unique models. These are Message in app imessages and Contacts in contacts. Which where added to give the User an opurtunity to message other Users directly and have private conversations.
#
### LucidChart

## Credits
#
## Thank you
- [Spencer Barriball](https://github.com/5pence) for always being there and being a fantastic mentor.
- Tutors at Code Institute
- Code Institute Slack-channel community for being the good and funny bunch of people I need!

### Content credits
- For the direct message(DM) a walkthru video from the account [Code With Stein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SF1k_Twr9cg) was used. However current project is not exactly the same, the biggest difference is the walkthru is a one to many relationship, while the DM function in this project is mainly a one to one relationship. Howevere there is a possibility to expand the app named contacts to include a one to many chat.

### Media
- For how to make the README nav-bar https://github.com/artkonekt/menu/blob/master/README.md was used.
- As template for README https://github.com/mikakallberg/Portfolio-Project-4 was used.
- The theme for this project is taken from Caroline Forseys [article](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/color-palette-inspiration) on Hubspot. The theme is called Atumn Color Palette.
